Features can be supercharged through the use of *decision sources*, which allow the decisions regarding the state of a feature to be influenced by a variety of sources. For example, you could have a feature disabled by default, except it's enabled when a specific environment variable is set or when a web API returns a certain response or after a certain date has passed, or any combination of these in priority order.
